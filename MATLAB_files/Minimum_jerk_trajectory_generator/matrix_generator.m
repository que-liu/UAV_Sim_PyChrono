function R = matrix_generator(sequence)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% matrix_generator finds the rotation matrix R given by the 'sequence' of
% simple rotations. 'sequence' must be a string of characters containing
% 3, 2, or 1 only.
%
% Example: 
%     sequence = '32132'; 
%     R = matrix_generator(sequence)
% 
%     sequence = '22'; 
%     R = matrix_generator(sequence)
% 
%     sequence = '323'; 
%     R = matrix_generator(sequence)
